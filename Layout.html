	<p>
	The order Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species. 
	The earliest known members of this group date from 157 million years 
	ago,[1] making turtles one 
	of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than snakes or 
    Turtles are ectotherms—animals <span>commonly</span> called cold-blooded—meaning that
    their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment. However,
    because of their high metabolic rate, leatherback sea turtles have a body
    temperature that is noticeably higher than that of the surrounding water.
